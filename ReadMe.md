# Ariadne

A Hollow Knight mod that logs collision boxes and takes screenshots. Its primary purpose is to gather snapshots for an object detection dataset. I may extend it to provide a realtime hitbox API for third party applications.

I also extended the Debug mod to have new categories and to clean up overlapping terrain hitboxes.
